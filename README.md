# HighEnergyGammarayDetectors

This is the code pipeline for processing the spectra obtained in the space detector lab. 
The HEGRD_main.py is the script that should be run with the spectra folder in the same directory. Input "python HEGRD_main.py spectra" to run, in which an input will then ask you for which detector to view. All plots are then shown and relations printed in the console.
